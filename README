In this assignment we to call the functions run make all on the command line
Now run ./image followed by the argument given below specific to the function

To call relu activation:
	activation_relu matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To call tanh activation:
	activation_tanh matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To do subsampling with maxpooling:
	subsampling_maxpooling matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To do subsampling with average pooling:
	subsampling_avgpooling matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To convert random float vector to probability vector using softmax:
	probability_softmax matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To convert random float vector to probability vector using sigmoid
	probability_sigmoid matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

NOTE: 
1. For sub-sampling (both odd and even) we have chosen the sampling matrix to be 2x2 and the stride to be 2 always.
2. For Max pooling we padded the odd size matrices and for average pooling we considered the average of only two elements 		when we reached the edge of the matrix.
3. For the convolution we inverted the kernel.
