In this assignment we to call the functions run make all on the command line
Now run ./image followed by the argument given below specific to the function

To call Convolution with padding with matrix multiplication:
	convolution_withpadding_matrixmult padsize mode matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows matrix2.txt matrix2_numrows

To call Convolution without padding with matrix multiplication:
	convolution_withoutpadding_matrixmult mode matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows matrix2.txt matrix2_numrows

where mode is 1 for normal multiplication, 2 for pthread, 3 for OpenBLAS, 4 for MKL.

To call Convolution with padding with Convolution:
	convolution_withpadding_conv padsize matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows matrix2.txt matrix2_numrows

To call Convolution without padding with Convolution:
	convolution_withoutpadding_conv matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows matrix2.txt matrix2_numrows

To call relu activation:
	activation_relu matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To call tanh activation:
	activation_tanh matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To do subsampling with maxpooling:
	subsampling_maxpooling matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To do subsampling with average pooling:
	subsampling_avgpooling matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To convert random float vector to probability vector using softmax:
	probability_softmax matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

To convert random float vector to probability vector using sigmoid
	probability_sigmoid matrix1.txt matrix1_numrows

NOTE: 
1. For sub-sampling (both odd and even) we have chosen the sampling matrix to be 2x2 and the stride to be 2 always.
2. For Max pooling we padded the odd size matrices and for average pooling we considered the average of only two elements 		when we reached the edge of the matrix.
3. For the convolution we inverted the kernel.

NOTE FOR SUBTASK 2:
1. We have tested the time of multiplication of the toeplitz matrix with pthread, openBLAS, mkl libraries against matrix of sizes 1000,900,750 & 500 and a kernel size of 3.
2. If the range of the y-axis in the png file is too small, the ps file has a elongated version.
3. The times in the graphs are in microseconds measured by the chrono high resolution clock.
4. This Subtask prints the time taken by the matrix multiplication for the matrix_multiplication command and prints the resultant matrix or vector.
